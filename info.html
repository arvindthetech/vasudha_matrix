            <h2>What is Carbon Footprint?</h2>
            <p>Just like an actual footprint it is a mark you leave upon the environment (not with your shoes ðŸ˜…) but with every action that releases carbon.<br>In the pursuit of sustainable business practices, it is crucial to comprehend and manage your carbon footprint. Your carbon footprint represents the total amount of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, that your business is directly or indirectly responsible for emitting into the atmosphere. These emissions contribute to climate change and environmental degradation.</p>
